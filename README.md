<summary>Learning Objectives</summary>

Students who complete the following will be able to:

- Describe how data is used to create generative processes in software, design, architecture, etc.
- Compare outcomes of generative processes across different disciplines.
- Write pseudo code to represent the procedural, data-driven process, and then code it with JS in a prototype
- Use HTML, CSS, JS to create the final application
- Design an identity for the project that communicates the theme or concept of the project

## About


This assignment asks you to create a web page that can generate new iterations of itself based on input from the user, available data (e.g. time, location, etc.), or pure randomness.

<a href="assets/img/Generative_Design_Process-retouched.png"><img src="assets/img/Generative_Design_Process-retouched.png" align="right" width="450"></a>

On one hand, almost all software and websites you interact with somehow generate an interface using information from a database and specific rules. Even boring shopping websites use cookies to identify and customize pages for users ([regardless who stands to benefit](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/amazon-marketplace-seller-pleads-guilty-price-fixing-dvds-and-blu-ray-discs)).

[Generative Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_design) is a related cultural trend that, similar to data-driven websites, uses coded rules and algorithms to create (and recreate) designs and concepts for architecture, objects, behaviors, animations, games, and much more. This diagram from the book, [Generative Design: Visualize, Program, and Create with JavaScript in p5.js](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/) by Groß, Bohnacker, and Laub, shows how these processes can create new iterations, using varying degrees of input from the creator, in order to ideate or solve specific design or aesthetic issues. Regardless of your approach, your project should mimic these processes somehow, reflecting your own thinking on this subject.
